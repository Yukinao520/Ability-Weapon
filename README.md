MC mod based on **Mcreator** creation.

This mod builds the base file based on Mcreator and exports external builds

This mod is going to be very many vulnerabilities and flawed.
Don't expect me to do well. ~~Buddy, I'm just bored~~
I don't have the extra energy or time to fix the various hard to fix or even unfixable problems that **McCreator** itself comes with, and this mod was initially just a realization of an idea my friend and I had
